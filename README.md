## 🚓 How it Works

1. **Waypoints are generated** randomly within a defined spawn area.
2. **The vehicle agent** autonomously navigates through the city using `NavMeshAgent` towards each waypoint.
3. **Situational updates** are communicated through TextMeshPro, showing real-time emergency status.
4. **On arrival**, the vehicle pauses and updates the message for the next operation.
5. The process repeats, ensuring continuous responsiveness and navigation.

## 🎯 Demo Output (UI)

```
🚑 Emergency Call: Navigating to Waypoint_3.
✅ Target Waypoint_3 Reached. Preparing next steps.
🚒 Rapid Response: Heading towards Waypoint_1.
🛑 Waypoint_1 secured. Awaiting further dispatch.
```

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

1. Create a Unity project and import TextMeshPro.
2. Set up a plane and bake a NavMesh for the environment.
3. Attach the `EmergencyVehicleAI.cs` script to a vehicle with `NavMeshAgent` functionality.
4. Place a **TextMeshProUGUI** element on the canvas for mission updates.
5. Assign waypoints prefab and text references in the Inspector.
6. Hit Play and witness the automated emergency response system in action!
